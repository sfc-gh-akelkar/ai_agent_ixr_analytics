## 🎬 Opening (0:00 - 2:00)

**Talking Points (aligned to FOCUS Challenges):**
> "PatientPoint operates 500,000 IoT devices—HealthScreen displays—across hospitals and clinics nationwide. These screens generate **advertising revenue from pharmaceutical partners**. When a screen fails, three things happen:
> 
> 1. **Lost Revenue**: Every hour offline means lost ad impressions and revenue
> 2. **High Costs**: Field dispatch costs $150-300 per visit
> 3. **Unpredictable Downtime**: Reactive maintenance means you don't know what's failing until it's down
> 
> Today I'll show you how Snowflake Intelligence and Cortex Agents solve all three with **predictive AI**."

**Actions:**
1. Open **Snowflake Intelligence** (AI & ML → Snowflake Intelligence)
2. Select the **Device Maintenance Assistant** agent
3. Briefly show the chat interface

---

### Prompt 2: Revenue Protection (addresses Challenge #1)
```
How much advertising revenue are we losing from device downtime?
```

**Transition:** *"Zero revenue loss this month—that's our revenue protection working. But how are we achieving this? Let's look at cost savings..."*

---

### Prompt 3: Cost Savings (addresses Challenge #2)
```
How much money have we saved this month from remote fixes vs field dispatches?
```

**Transition:** *"That's $2,500+ saved this month—on track for 40-60% reduction in field service costs. But I noticed the NPS score. Let's check customer satisfaction..."*

---

### Prompt 4: Customer Pulse (follows from NPS mention)
```
What is our customer satisfaction score and which facilities need follow-up?
```

**Transition:** *"I see Springfield Urgent Care flagged for follow-up. Let's hand this over to Operations to understand what's happening there..."*

## 🖥️ Act 2: Operations Center (6:00 - 12:00)

*Persona: IT Manager / Facilities Operations*

### Scene Setup
> "Now let's switch to the Operations Center. The executive just flagged Springfield Urgent Care. But as an ops manager, you need to see the full picture of what's at risk today."

---

### Prompt 1: What's At Risk Right Now?
```
Which devices have critical or high risk levels right now?
```

**Transition:** *"I see 7 devices flagged—including DEV-005 at Springfield Urgent Care that the executive mentioned. Before I dispatch technicians, let me see if any of these can be fixed remotely..."*

---

### Prompt 2: Triage for Remote Fixes (follows naturally)
```
Can any of these critical or high risk devices be fixed remotely?
```

**Transition:** *"Great—the agent identified that HIGH_CPU and MEMORY_LEAK issues can be fixed remotely with 92% success rate. Let me try that first on DEV-005..."*

---

### Prompt 3: Deep Dive on Problem Device (follows from triage)
```
What's the status of device DEV-005 at Springfield Urgent Care and what's causing the issue?
```

**Transition:** *"I see it's a network connectivity issue—that explains the degraded status. This facility has had 3 network issues in 60 days. Let me check if we already have work orders for this..."*

---

### Prompt 4: Work Order Status (follows from device issue)
```
Show me all active work orders and their priority
```

**Transition:** *"I see there's already a CRITICAL work order for DEV-005. Good—let's make sure a technician is assigned and has what they need..."*

---

### Prompt 5: Predictive Intelligence
```
Which devices are predicted to fail in the next 48 hours?
```

**Transition:** *"This is the power of predictive maintenance—we can see failures 24-48 hours before they happen. Now watch this—the agent can also trigger actions..."*

---

### Prompt 6: Automated Action (Key Demo Moment! 🎯)
```
Can you attempt a remote restart on device DEV-003 to fix the high CPU issue?
```

**Talking Point:** *"Notice what just happened—the agent didn't just recommend an action, it triggered a simulated API call to the device management system. In production, this would actually restart the device."*

**Follow-up to show the log:**
```
Show me recent external actions that were triggered
```

*Show: V_RECENT_EXTERNAL_ACTIONS displays the API call that was logged*

> **💡 Key Message:** "Cortex Agents aren't just chatbots—they can execute actions. With External Functions, this same pattern connects to ServiceNow, Slack, PagerDuty, or your device management API."

**Transition:** *"The agent just demonstrated the full loop: detect → diagnose → act. Now let's see this from the technician's perspective..."*

---

### Key Takeaways for Operations
| Capability | Demo Evidence |
|------------|---------------|
| 🎯 Real-time risk detection | 7 devices flagged across fleet |
| 🔧 Remote fix triage | AI recommends most cost-effective action |
| 📍 Facility pattern recognition | Springfield flagged for network audit |
| 🔮 48-hour predictions | Lead time to prevent failures |
