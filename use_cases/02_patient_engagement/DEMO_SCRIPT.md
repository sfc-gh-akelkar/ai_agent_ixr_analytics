How accurate is our churn prediction model based on historical data?
```

**Expected Response:**
- Prediction accuracy percentage
- Historical validation data

> 💡 **Value Driver:** *"This is the key insight—we can predict churn with X% accuracy. That means we can intervene before it's too late."*

**Transition:** *"Strong prediction capability. But what's driving this? Let's look at the correlation between engagement and outcomes..."*

> "Now let's validate the core hypothesis: Does engagement actually correlate with better outcomes? This is the proof point for the entire program."

---

### Prompt 1: The Correlation Question (H2)
```
Does patient engagement correlate with health outcome improvements?
```

**Expected Response:**
- High engagement improvement rate vs low engagement
- Statistical comparison
- Outcome types analyzed

**Talking Point:** *"Look at that difference—X% improvement for high engagement vs Y% for low engagement. That's a Z percentage point difference."*

---

### Prompt 2: Statistical Breakdown
```
Compare health outcome improvement rates between high, medium, and low engagement patients
```
