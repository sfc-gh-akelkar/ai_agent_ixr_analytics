  Create Semantic Views for Snowflake Intelligence / Cortex Analyst (Split Views)

  This script creates multiple narrowly scoped semantic views (recommended) so
  Snowflake Intelligence / Cortex Analyst can be configured with focused tools.

  Prereqs:
  - Run sql/01_setup_database.sql
  - Run sql/02_generate_sample_data.sql
  - Run sql/20_intelligence_semantic_layer.sql

  Docs:
  - CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW syntax: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view
